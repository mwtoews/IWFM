Executables with "PLL" in their names use parallel processing; i.e. they utilize more than one CPU 
at the same time. These executables may provide some speed-up depending on the computer hardware.
To be able to use these executables, "libiomp5md.dll" file must be present in the same folder that 
the executable is located or in the C:\Windows\System32 folder.
